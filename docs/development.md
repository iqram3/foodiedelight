# Development Guidelines for FoodieDelight Project

## Introduction

This document outlines development guidelines and best practices for the FoodieDelight project to ensure consistency, maintainability, and efficient collaboration among developers.

## Coding Standards

- **Code Formatting**: Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components.
- **Type Safety**: Utilize TypeScript for type definitions and interfaces.

## Component Structure

- **Folder Structure**: Organize components into `components` for UI and `containers` for logic-driven components.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain separation between business logic and presentation logic.

## State Management

- **Local State**: Prefer `useState` and `useReducer` for managing local component state.
- **Global State**: Integrate with Redux for managing global application state.

## Styling Guidelines

- **CSS Modules**: Use CSS modules for scoped styling.
- **Class Naming**: Name CSS classes based on component names and functionality.

## API Integration

- **HTTP Requests**: Utilize Axios for making HTTP requests.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API responses.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Write tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Mocking**: Mock API responses and components for reliable testing.

## Deployment

- **Environment Setup**: Configure deployment environments with environment variables.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate deployments using GitHub Actions.

## Version Control

- **Branching Model**: Use GitFlow (master, develop, feature branches) for version management.
- **Commit Guidelines**: Follow conventional commit messages.

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Data Handling**: Securely manage authentication tokens and sensitive information.

## Documentation Standards

- **JSDoc Comments**: Document functions and complex logic using JSDoc format.
- **README.md**: Maintain an up-to-date README.md with setup instructions and project overview.

## Contributing Guidelines

- **Fork and Pull Model**: Encourage contributions via fork and pull requests.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews for quality and knowledge sharing.
