# Development Guidelines for FoodieDelight Project

## Introduction

This document outlines development guidelines and best practices for the FoodieDelight project to ensure consistency, maintainability, and efficient collaboration among developers.

## Coding Standards

- **Code Formatting**: Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components.
- **Type Safety**: Utilize TypeScript for type definitions and interfaces.


## Code Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the application.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `pages/`: Contains page components that correspond to different routes.
  - `utils/`: Contains utility functions and helpers.
  - `hooks/`: Contains custom React hooks.
  - `styles/`: Contains global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API responses.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Write tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Mocking**: Mock API responses and components for reliable testing.

## Version Control

- **Branching Model**: Use GitFlow (master, develop, feature branches) for version management.
- **Commit Guidelines**: Follow conventional commit messages.

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Documentation Standards
